      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
         Vinjar Kvamme built the QuickLog app as
         a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by
         Vinjar Kvamme at no cost and is intended for use as
         is.
      </p>
      <p>
         This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
         policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
         Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
      </p>
      <p>
         If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to
         the collection and use of information in relation to this
         policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
         used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with
         anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
         The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
         as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at
         QuickLog unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
      <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
      </p> 
      <p>
         For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. 
         This may include access to your call log data to help track business-related calls for billing purposes. 
         The call data is processed on-device and is not shared with any third-party services. 
         The app only accesses and processes call log information necessary for its core functionality—allowing users to log and manage billable calls. 
         The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me.
      </p>
      <div>
         <p>
            QuickLog does not transmit call logs, call metadata, or any other sensitive information to external servers.
         </p>
         <p>
            The app does use third-party services that may collect
            information used to identify you.

      <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
      <p>
         I want to inform you that whenever you
         use my Service, in a case of an error in the app
         I collect data and information (through third-party
         products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
         include information such as your device Internet Protocol
         (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
         configuration of the app when utilizing my Service,
         the time and date of your use of the Service, and other
         statistics.

      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      </p> 
      <p>

         commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
         to your browser from the websites that you visit and are

         This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
         the app may use third-party code and libraries that use
         “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.

      <h2>Service Providers</h2>
      </p> 
      <p>
         I may employ third-party companies and
         individuals due to the following reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>

         Information to perform the tasks assigned to
         them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
         disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

      <p>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      </p> 
      <p>
         I value your trust in providing us your
         Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
         acceptable means of protecting it. However, please note that no method
         of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
         storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
         guarantee absolute security.

      <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
      </p> 
      <p>
         This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
         a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
         that these external sites are not operated by me.
         Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
         Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
         no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
         privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or

      <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
      </p> 
      <div>
         <p>
            These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
            I do not knowingly collect personally
            identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case
            I discover that a child under 13 has provided
            me with personal information, I immediately
            delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
            and you are aware that your child has provided us with
            personal information, please contact me so that
            I will be able to do the necessary actions.

      <h2>Call Log Data Handling</h2>
      </p> 
      <div>
         <p>
            QuickLog requires access to your call log data 
			(through the android.permission.READ_CALL_LOG permission) for its core functionality—tracking,
			categorizing, and managing billable calls. 
			This data is only used locally on the device to 
			allow users to log business-related calls for billing purposes. 
			It is not shared or transmitted to external servers. 
			Users have control over this data and can delete or export it as needed for their own business use.
